	When this option is configured Jenkins aggregates the results of the static analysis plug-ins
    Checkstyle, Dry, FindBugs, PMD, Tasks, and Warnings. These aggregated analysis results are then
    used as input for the historical result trend, module and package statistics, web UI for viewing
    analysis reports and warnings, health reporting and build stability.
